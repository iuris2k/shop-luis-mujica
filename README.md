## My Project

This project was created with the idea of being an E-commerce for electronic items.

We have 6 products in inventory with a stock of 5 items each.

The idea is to classify the categories:

- `Computers`
- `Phones`
- `Etc.`

We will also choose each product to see its details.

Finally, we will upload our purchase to the cart.
